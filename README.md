# Getting Started

## Structure

Repository contains two projects

 - [ngx-social-auth](https://github.com/dmytro-parfenov/ngx-social-auth/tree/master/projects/ngx-social-auth) - library source code
 - [ngx-social-auth-demo](https://github.com/dmytro-parfenov/ngx-social-auth/tree/master/projects/ngx-social-auth-demo) - used for testing the library and provides demo application 


## Development

Run `npm run start:lib` for a build library. The library will automatically rebuild if you change any of the source files from [ngx-social-auth](https://github.com/dmytro-parfenov/ngx-social-auth/tree/master/projects/ngx-social-auth).

Run `npm run start:demo` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files from [ngx-social-auth-demo](https://github.com/dmytro-parfenov/ngx-social-auth/tree/master/projects/ngx-social-auth-demo).

It is necessary to run `npm run start:lib` before `npm run start:demo` to ensure that library has already built before the demo application will run.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test:lib` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) for the library.

Run `npm run test:demo` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) for the demo application.

## Build

Run `npm run build:lib:prod` to make a production build of the library. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/ngx-social-auth2` directory.

Run `npm run build:demo:prod` to make a production build of the demo application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/ngx-social-auth-demo` directory.

## Documentation

Run `npm run docs:lib` to build the documentation for the library. The build artifacts will be stored in the `docs` directory.
